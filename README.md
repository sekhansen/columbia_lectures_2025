## Course Title: AI and Unstructured Data for Measurement and Estimation

### Part I

Briefly reviews traditional methods for text-as-data analysis in economics based on word counts. We then introduce word embeddings, which represent words as low-dimensional vectors that capture semantic relationships. Next, we discuss how modern Large Language Models combine word embeddings to generate word predictions. Throughout, we discuss economic applications of the methods.

### Part II

This lecture discusses how to adapt pre-trained language models to economic measurement problems, including sentiment and policy uncertainty. We compare the performance of different methods in concrete settings.

### Part III

This lecture discusses the problem of using AI-generated regressors in downstream regression models with a focus on inference. We cover the data science literature that relies on the existence of a validation sample before introducing new methods that deal with the empirically relevant case of limited validation data.
